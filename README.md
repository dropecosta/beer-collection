### Features (Requirements)

- [x] An overview of bottles in the collection (flexbox or grid layout)
- [x] Detailed view
- [x] Possibility to add new bottles
- [x] You can use a remote API (https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2 or similar) to fill in
additional data

Inspiration for functionality if you have time:
- [x] Sorting in list view (Sort by name, type, year, etc.).
- [x] Filtering in list view (filter on type, year, etc.).
- [x] Add the user's comment / notes / rating.
- [x] Save entries on the device.

Your solution will be evaluated on the following:
‚Ä¢ Code quality
‚Ä¢ Code architecture and organization
‚Ä¢ Does the solution work?
‚Ä¢ Does the layout work on both phone and desktop?
‚Ä¢ Implementing your own creative ideas

Rules:
‚Ä¢ Use NextJS to build the web-app.
‚Ä¢ You are free to spend as much time as you want.
‚Ä¢ It must be clearly noted if there are parts of the code you have not written yourself.
‚Ä¢ You may want to use a build-setup - this setup is not included in the assessment.
Please supply documentation for how to run the app (a CLI command like ‚Äúnpm start‚Äù
or similar is fine).
‚Ä¢ Your solution must be handed in as a git repository (if private on github, please reach
out to us, for who to add to the repo).
‚Ä¢ Add a readme file to the root of the project, explaining your architecture
considerations, your priorities and whatever else you think could be important for us to
know or pay attention to.
‚Ä¢ Feel free to substitute the ‚ÄúBeer collection‚Äù and API with something else
